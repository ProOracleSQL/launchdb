3. Change Hashing diagrams in Chapter 16 - use 4 diagrams instead of 3.
4. Try Kaley's example code for hashing - maybe it does work in some cases?
5. "TEST_FUNCTION" in Chapter 21 - add a blank line or the NULL.
6. Change the MODEL example to avoid multiple spaces.
7. Improve index?
8. In sequence caching, add discussion about large batch sizes and scalable sequences reducing contention on pk index because numbers are so different.
