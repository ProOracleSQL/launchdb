Pro Oracle SQL Development Examples
===================================

These files contain the SQL statements used in the book Pro Oracle SQL Development.

The examples were built using SQL\*Plus formatting but I **strongly** recommend you develop SQL with a graphical IDE, such as PL/SQL Developer, Toad, or Oracle SQL Developer.  I only used SQL\*Plus to make the output simple and easy to add to the book.


How to Install
--------------

Install the SpaceDB to use these examples.  Each file is a worksheet that contains different queries for each chapter.
